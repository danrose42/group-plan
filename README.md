## groupplan.io (name tbc) is a lightweight, clean and intuitive tool to help you and your friends find the best date for any social event

### Key features

* Doesn’t require any login - only requires name/initial to get started.
* Creating a calendar generates a unique URL that you then send to your friends and they’re immediately in the same calendar too.
* Doesn’t require event ‘form fill’ - 1 click to say available 2 for not etc.
* Maybe allow person to select themself from previous entrees – deals with cross platform sessions. Option to toggle any individual off to deal will drop-outs/dead banter?
* Each calendar deletes itself after no activity for 7? days. But maybe allow file download (and upload?) if desired.

### Areas to reasearch / work on
* THE DESIGN
*	Dealing with multiple people editing at one – potentially solved by keeping per-person date objects separate.
*	Media preview / URL cleanliness.
*	Potential revenue options – unobtrusive ads / subscription for unlimited length storage and no ads.
